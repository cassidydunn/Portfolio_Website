This is a folder for my SQL projects.

I have had a lot of experience with SQL. In my freshman year of college, I took my first SQL class and loved it from there. I later took an advanced SQL course at the college my sophmore year and then again in my masters degree. I also have taken numerous online courses for SQL and used it every day in my previous 2 roles. I feel very comfortable with SQL and enjoy using it.
